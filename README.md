# EclipseRetroTheme
Based off of the UI(or rather, lack therof) older computers had, such as the Apple II, and Commodore 64. However, it does include multiple colors, because as cool as it would be to have a theme that exactly resembles the interfaces of the past, it would be very quite impractical.

Note that this does require the Darkest Dark Theme with DevStyle extension, which can be found at: https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/darkest-dark-theme-devstyle
